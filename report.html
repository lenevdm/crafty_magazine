    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Craftly is a magazine based in Cape Town. It mainly focuses on sewing and targets sewing hobiests and textile artists. I chose a simple structure for the website. Each new issue of the magazine takes center stage on the home page. The cover story has a big image that links to the main article as the very first thing you see, similar to how you would interact with a physical magazine.
        <br><br>
        From the landing page, below the main article, readers can access the other articles contained in the latest issue. These articles are layed out in a grid format, with a small post image and the title.
        <br><br>
        From the menu at the top of the page, readers can access some key pages:
        <ul>
            <li>The About page for information about the editorial team and office locations.</li>
            <li>The Subscribe page, which offers information on subscription options.</li>
            <li>The Sew-along page, which is a key feature of the magazine. Each issue provides a new free sewing pattern that readers can access and use.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
        During the various lockdowns we've had in Cape Town during the pandemic, I started playing around with an antique Singer sewing machine that belonged to my great grandmother. I admired the simplicity of the machine, and was astonished that it still sewed a perfect line of straight stitches after almost 100 years. I wanted to pay homage to it somehow in this website, so I added a simple dashed line border around some elements in a contrasting colour to reference the stitching pattern of the machine. I also used some sewing-related iconography as a nod to the craft.
        <br>

        <br><br>        
        In teaching myself how to sew, I was exposed to the Instagram sewing community, and took a lot of inspiration from various blogs and image grids I saw on this platform. In particular, I enjoyed visiting the <a href="https://capetowncraftclub.wordpress.com/" style="color:rgb(255, 59, 63)">Cape Town Craft Club</a> and <a href="https://inthefolds.com/" style="color:rgb(255, 59, 63)">In the Folds</a> websites for inspiration. What I liked about both these websites where the simplicity. They were also both well-structured and easy to navigate.

        <br><br>
        Another point of inspiration for me was the <a href="https://www.kinfolk.com/" style="color:rgb(255, 59, 63)">Kinfolk</a>  magazine website. I looked at various magazine websites to get an understanding for how they look and what kind of structure they tend to have. Again, I liked the simplicity of the design, and based my home page design with the front page image and main article being front and center for each new issue on Kinfolk's design.
